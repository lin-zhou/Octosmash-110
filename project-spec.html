Title: Octosmash 110

Description: Multiplayer projectile-based fighting game inspired by Super Smash Flash, using characters from Nintendo's Octopath Traveler

Team Members: Lindsay Zhou and Shara He

110 Programming Concepts Used:
    - Object-oriented programming
        - Player and magic (projectile) classes and their respective methods were used to implement game logic.
        - The game itself is an object. One future goal is to make it so that clicking enter at the end creates a new Game and runs it.
        - We relied heavily on properties for things that were similar in our game, like the different individual bullets and the players.
    - Arrays
        - Arrays were used to keep track of the projectile weapons on the screen. This allowed us to limit the number of projectiles that could exist at once.
    - For loops
        - We used for loops in the ticker so that the game would run continuously.
        - For loops also helped to limit the projectiles within the arrays based on the array length.
    - If statements
        - We used if statements to check for many player inputs.
            - This includes keyboard events for movement. If the input was a certain key, the player would move in the corresponding direction.
        - If statements also determined which character sprite would render based on the players' choices.
            - If the player clicked within a specific region on the display, the program would assign a corresponding character sprite to the player object.

Challenges Overcome/New Concepts Learned:
    - We learned to work with aspects of the PixiJS library.
    - We struggled transitioning from functional to object-oriented programming, which is generally more appropriate for a video game.
        - Many of the classes we have now still need to be adjusted for OOP.
    - We worked with event listeners for keyboard and mouse events.
    - This was our first experience working with HTML and CSS.

Individual Contributions:
    Lindsay:
        - Start & selection screens
        - Character sprites
        - Double jump + gravity
        - Shielding & sidestep
        - Movement
            - Reflecting sprite after turning around (+ changing sprite location to adjust visually)
        - Damage counter + weighted knockback
    Shara:
        - Projectiles
            - Collision
            - Projectile reflection
    Both:
        - Boundaries for stage
        - Movement controls
        - Fonts & PIXI.Text
        - Creative design & planning!

Goals Achieved:
    - Functional motion
    - Attacking & damage
    - Game Over state
    - Decent visual presentation
    - Multiple character options

Future Work:
    - Rewriting with more OOP/simplifying code/eliminating repetitive code
    - Allow for up to four players
    - Multiple stages to choose from
    - Fix finicky places in the corners of the stage
        - Sometimes can't jump after walking off stage
    - Call runGame() method again instead of stacking sprites on top of each other
    - Different colored magic blast sprites either between p1 and p2 or for each character
    - Multiple lives + respawning
    - Sound effects!
    - For the Shielding System
        - Shield can only take x number of hits
            - Cooldown = x number of hits must be taken by the player maybe
        - Maybe make shield a property in player class
    - Healing items/other item spawns
    - Nicer title screen
    - More visual refinement
