<h2> Description: Multiplayer projectile-based fighting game inspired by Super Smash Flash, using characters from Nintendo's Octopath Traveler</h2>

<h2>Team Members: Lindsay Zhou and Shara He</h2>

<h3>Programming Concepts Used:</h3>
    <p>- Object-oriented programming </p>
        <p>- Player and magic (projectile) classes and their respective methods were used to implement game logic.</p>
        <p>- The game itself is an object. One future goal is to make it so that clicking enter at the end creates a new Game and runs it.</p>
        <p>- We relied heavily on properties for things that were similar in our game, like the different individual bullets and the players.</p>
    <p>- Arrays</p>
        <p>- Arrays were used to keep track of the projectile weapons on the screen. This allowed us to limit the number of projectiles that could exist at once.</p>
    <p>- For loops</p>
        <p>- We used for loops in the ticker so that the game would run continuously.</p>
        <p>- For loops also helped to limit the projectiles within the arrays based on the array length.</p>
    <p>- If statements</p>
        <p>- We used if statements to check for many player inputs.</p>
            <p>- This includes keyboard events for movement. If the input was a certain key, the player would move in the corresponding direction.</p>
        <p>- If statements also determined which character sprite would render based on the players' choices.</p>
            <p>- If the player clicked within a specific region on the display, the program would assign a corresponding character sprite to the player object.</p>

<h3>Challenges Overcome/New Concepts Learned:</h3>
    <p>- We learned to work with aspects of the PixiJS library.</p>
    <p>- We struggled transitioning from functional to object-oriented programming, which is generally more appropriate for a video game.</p>
    <p> - Many of the classes we have now still need to be adjusted for OOP.</p>
    <p> - We worked with event listeners for keyboard and mouse events.</p>
    <p>  - This was our first experience working with HTML and CSS.</p>



<h3>Individual Contributions:</h3>
<h4> Lindsay:</h4>
<p> - Start & selection screens</p>
<p>     - Character sprites</p>
<p>     - Double jump + gravity</p>
<p>     - Shielding & sidestep</p>
<p>     - Movement</p>
<p>         - Reflecting sprite after turning around (+ changing sprite location to adjust visually)</p>
<p>     - Damage counter + weighted knockback</p>
<h4> Shara:</h4>
<p>     - Projectiles</p>
<p>         - Collision</p>
<p>         - Projectile reflection</p>
<p>     - Project spec HTML</p>
<h4> Both:</h4>
<p>     - Boundaries for stage</p>
<p>     - Movement controls</p>
<p>     - Fonts & PIXI.Text</p>
<p>     - Creative design & planning!</p>

<h3>Goals Achieved:</h3>
<p> - Functional motion</p>
<p> - Attacking & damage</p>
<p> - Game Over state</p>
<p> -Decent visual presentation</p>
<p> - Multiple character options</p>

<h3>Future Work:</h3>
<p> - Rewriting with more OOP/simplifying code/eliminating repetitive code</p>
<p> - Allow for up to four players</p>
<p> - Multiple stages to choose from</p>
<p> - Fix finicky places in the corners of the stage</p>
<p>     - Sometimes can't jump after walking off stage</p>
<p> - Call runGame() method again instead of stacking sprites on top of each other</p>
<p> - Different colored magic blast sprites either between p1 and p2 or for each character</p>
<p> - Multiple lives + respawning</p>
<p> - Sound effects!</p>
<p> - For the Shielding System</p>
<p>     - Shield can only take x number of hits</p>
<p>         - Cooldown = x number of hits must be taken by the player maybe</p>
<p>    - Maybe make shield a property in player class</p>
<p> - Healing items/other item spawns</p>
<p> - Nicer title screen</p>
<p> - More visual refinement</p>
