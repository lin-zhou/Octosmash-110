# OCTOSMASH 110
Octosmash 110 is a two-player fighting game inspired by the Super Smash Bros series and written in TypeScript using the PixiJS library. This repository contains all of the files necessary to run the game. The game can also be accessed through [this link](http://apps.introcs.com/linzhou/z-hack-110/octosmash-110.html) without any downloads.

## Background Information
Octosmash 110 began as a project for Hack 110, a hackathon hosted by UNC-Chapel Hill's COMP 110: Introduction to Programming class during the fall semester of 2018. However, it quickly turned into partner passion project that served as a fun way to combine elements of programming that we learned over the semester.
